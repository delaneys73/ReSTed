To use this you will need to install python, On linux you should already have it by default just type python --version at the command prompt to confirm.

On windows you'll need to install it from http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/python-2.7.2.msi, Accept the default location c:\python27 and complete the install

Once installed open up a command line window and change into this directory and type install-rested (On ubuntu type sudo install-rested), this will install the python libraries required.

Next add a path entry for rested that points to this directory.

On Linux/Unix you'll need an additional step to edit the INSTALL_PATH to the absolute path to the directory you installed ReSTed into.

You should now be able to open an installer by typing rested <path to edit> at the command prompt.
